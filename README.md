# KShips 🚢

**KShips is a battleship port to the Kindle!**

There is 3 styles of difficulty Easy, Medium and Hard
 
- Easy: Random shooting only
- Medium: 70% chance to target adjacent cells after a hit
- Hard: Always targets adjacent cells intelligently after scoring a hit

## Minimum Requirements 

 - AdBreak, WinterBreak, or LanguageBreak
 - Latest Universal Hotfix
 - Both hard-float and soft-float kindles should work, but not all packages may support both architectures.

## Installation
> [!NOTE]
> This is my first Kindle Game/App so it is kinda bad!

1. Grab the latest file from releases
2. Unzip it, paste both `KShips/` and `KShips.sh` into the `documents/` folder on your Kindle.
3. Run the scriptlet, and have fun!

## Features

- Three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) with progressively smarter AI
- Full Battleship gameplay with 5 ships (Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Submarine, Destroyer)
- AI that intelligently attacks back and hunts down your ships
- Ship placement with manual positioning, rotation, and random placement options
